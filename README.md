# Boatclub application

The program is mainly used by moving through the different menus, currently being two. One for members and one for boats.

These are easily transversable and usable. Everything should be straight forward to use by just following the wording in the application. 

There are some limitations as to having enough letters in a name or using only numbers in creating a boat length.
