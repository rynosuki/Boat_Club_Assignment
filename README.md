# Boatclub application

There are some limitations as to having enough letters in a name or using only numbers in creating a boat length.


# Usage
The program is mainly used by moving through the different menus, currently being two. One for members and one for boats.  
These are easily transversable and usable. Everything should be straight forward to use by just following the wording in the application.

1. Add member
2. Delete member
3. Change member
4. View member details
5. Show verbose list
6. Show compact list

Step 1: Choose a member to add/remove/change a boat for.  

Step 2: Choose from menu.
1. Add Boat
2. Remove Boat      
3. Change Boat      
4. Back to menu
